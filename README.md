# odin-recipes

My attempt at the Recipes Project, created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

In this project, I will create a basic website revolving around a short list of recipes. This project will demonstrate my ability to properly write and format HTML files, as well as show my newly-leaned skills of proper structure and organization of website files in ways that facilitates navigation and usability.

See [the Recipes Project page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) for the guidelines I am following for this learning project.
